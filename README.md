## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Joy Ehiedu, a **Mobile Developer** (specializing in **Flutter Framework**) and a **Top Rated** [**Freelancer**](https://joy-ehiedu.netlify.app/), also avaialbe for _remote_. I am a graduate of **Computer Engineering**, University of Benin.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have contributed to several Organizations including, **Material UI**, **Flutter Dev**, and countless others. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2020, I learned **User Interface Design**, **App Design**, **Mobile Deevlopment Basics** in 2022, **Dart Programming language** and **Flutter framework**. I got started with [**Freelancing**] and [**Blogging**](https://buildclaw.com/blog/) quite recently and made a name for myself.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **reading novels**, **exercising** and **designing** to some whacky ones like **learnning a new thing**.

📚 I also love reading books on **design thinking** & **psychology**. My favorite ones are **Thinking fast and slow** by _Daniel Kahneman_ in the genre of psychology and **Predictably Irrational** by _Dan Ariely_.

✈️ I love **traveling** as well.
